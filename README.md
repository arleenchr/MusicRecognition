## Description
Music Recognition is a simple monophonic music recognition. The program implements the Boyer-Moore pattern matching algorithm and the Levensthein Distance to calculate the similarity percentage between two monophonic music.

## Requirements
- Java 18.0

## How to Use
## Cloning Repository
```git clone https://github.com/arleenchr/MusicRecognition.git```

### Compiling Program
Open terminal on the repository root directory
```javac -d ./out/ ./src/*.java```
This command will compile all of the Java classes into folder `out`

### Running Program
Make sure that `Main.class` exists on folder `out`. If the `Main.class` has not existed yet, compile the program first.
Open terminal on the `out` folder directory
```java Main```
